            <p class="texto">Inflation in Peru: The inflation recently in Peru has been interesting. It has eased to 8.41% ( it has been straight for 2 months now). In August 2022 it was 8.74%, this is the lowest sense. Monthly,  consumer prices were up by 0.67%, following a 0.94% rise in the prior month. This is because of a slowdown  in prices of restaurants and  hotels (0.63% vs 0.79% in July) and a decrease in transport costs (-0.87% vs 2.49%). In other aspects prices may have increased for food & non-alcoholic beverages with 1.71% vs 1.56%, housing & utilities.

            <p class="texto">For five surprising years, from 1968 to 1973, Peru achieved the near miracle of social reform combined with good economic growth. As if in revenge, the classic catastrophes that have plagued so many Latin American countries when they have tried to move in new directions then surged up to stop the process: a foreign exchange crisis, accelerating inflation, paralysed growth, rising unemployment, and intensified social conflict. Was all this necessary? What might have been done better? And what might be done now to resume growth without further taking apart the reforms?</p>

            <li class="titulo2">Resources</li>
            <p class="texto"> Even though,  Copper, iron, lead, zinc, bismuth, phosphates, gold, silver,  other hard to find metals, and  hydroelectric potential are sources for peru, the main resource for peru right now are the services, this feature is about the  60% of the GDP. Peru’s services sector is mainly Telecommunications and financial services, these two by themselves  can make up about 40% of the GDP. Peru has still a long way to go especially in modernization, but it has been working on it and with that industry that is about 35% of GDP has also kodernizided making employment  increase in the country’s primary industrial areas.</p>

            <p class="texto"> - The concept of “personal space” is very different from the Western world. When talking with someone, Peruvian people stand very close to them. You might find it uncomfortable in the first place. Even if you do, then try not to back away or appear unfriendly. This is considered rude in Peruvian custom.<br>
            - When greeting anyone for the first time, Peruvian people usually shake hands. However, if they know the person, men often greet other men with a pat on their back and women generally kiss each other on the cheek. When meeting someone for the first time, address them by “Señor” or “Señora”, followed by their last names. In Peru, only friends and family can address each other by the first names. It is considered polite to greet people you meet even if that person is a taxi driver.</p>
