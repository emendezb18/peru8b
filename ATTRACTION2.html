        <p class="texto">The Colca Canyon is one of the deepest canyons in the world and almost as big as the Grand Canyon. It has a depth of about 3,400 meters and that is the effect of a seismic fault between two volcanoes. Even though it is currently an attraction that many people visit, it wasn't always like this, because it has been inhabited for many thousands of years, and it was also a place where Collagua, Cabana and also Inca People lived. These people were the ones that used stone terracing along the canyon walls many years ago, and to this day people are still doing it. Since the ancient people lived Many feet below the canyon, trips there are really long and it is recommended for it to be two days long.</p>
