        <p class="texto">Machu Picchu is one of the most popular settings of a ruined city that lived a lot of years ago. It is a zone of jungle covered mountains close to a river down below, where the Incas used to have their city. In 1911, someone named Hiram Bingham found Machu Picchu and it wasn´t until his death that people finally agreed that it was the “Lost City of the Incas'' first documented by Spanish soldiers during the 1500s. Machu Picchu is important to indigenous cultural heritage. The ancient city might be called the crowning achievement of Incan culture and spiritually. From a town below Machu Picchu a 20-minute bus ride can take you up to the mountains and get you to Machu Picchu. You can also walk up to the mountains using the same road but it will take much more time to get there and many people don't like this way.</p>
