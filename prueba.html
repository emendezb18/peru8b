        <h2 class="titulo2">Coastal plain & Andes Mountains</h2>

        <p class="parrafo">The coastal plain soils tend to have sandy top soils and clayey subsoil. These soils are low in  plant nutrients and acidic.gravel, sandmount, silt, clay, marl, limestone, and uncommon layers of concentrated shell material called coquina are some rocks that can be found in the coastal plain.   The minerals that can be founded are: gypsum
            Bauxite, phosphate, bentonite, mica, titanium, zirconium, perlite, and vermiculite. Coordinates: 10 00 S, 76 00 W. <br>

            The Andes mountains consist of several extremely high peaks surrounded by even higher peaks. They are located about 8,900 kilometers from the southern tip of South America to the continent's northernmost coast on the Caribbean. The Andes mountains are one of the best places to get minerals in the world; they provide more than 45% of the world's copper production and about 30% of the silver pro- duction. They also provide: lead, zinc, and gold.<br>

        <h2 class="titulo2">Amazonian jungle,Ausangate Peru Rainbow Mountain, and the Andean Volcanic Belt</h2>
        <p class="parrafo">
            The Amazonian jungle takes more than half of the Peruvian landscape, being home for more than 50,000 plant species, as well as 400 types of mammals and nearly 2,000 types of birds. Even though Amazonian jungle soils tend to be poor in nutrients and in some parts sandy, lots of things still grow on them. The loss of nutrients  is the result of erosion for over over hundreds of millions of years.Some of the minerals that can be found in the  Amazonian jungle are: copper, tin, nickel, bauxite, manganese, iron ore and gold.<br>

            Ausangate is the tallest mountain in cusco and the fifth tallest in peru. The tallest that it can get is 6,385 m.s.n.m. and it is situated 100km from cusco. Coordinates: 13°47'19″S 71°13'52″W. This mountain is very popular for tourism because of its colors. The colors of this mountain are made up of soils and minerals; the pink color is red clay made out of mud and sand, the white color is quartzose, sandstone and marls, the red color is claysones (iron), green is phyllites (ferro magnesian), the brown is fanglomerate (magnesium), and the yellow is calcareous (sulfur).<br>

            The Andean Volcanic Belt is a bunch of volcanoes located in the Andes mountains that pass through ecuador, chile, colombia, peru, bolivia, and argentina. The soil that is found in the Andean Volcanic Belt is a special soil with unique physical and chemical properties largely attributable to the formation of poorly crystalline and noncrystalline minerals, and the accumulation of organic matter. Some of the minerals that can be found in  these areas are: aluminum, diamonds, gold, nickel, lead, zinc, and copper.<br>

        <h2 class="titulo2">Amazon river & Titicaca Lake</h2>
        <p class="parrafo">
            The Amazon river is the biggest river in the world. It passes through Peru, Colombia, and Brazil. It contains more sweet water than the nilo, yangtsé, and the mississippi all together. The Amazon river is about one fifth of the sweet water in the world.<br>
            The Titicaca  lake is an important source of humidity and a moderating element of the climate. “Titicaca sits 3.810 m above sea level and is situated between Peru to the west and Bolivia to the east.”<br>

        <h2 class="titulo2">Llanganuco Lakes & Lake Sandoval</h2>
        <p class="parrafo">
            The Llanganuco lakes are used mainly for tourism.  The Llanganuco lakes are divided by 2  the Chinancocha and Orconcocha which are part of the Huascaran National Park situated in the cordillera blanca. They are located between a group of mountains called the Huascaran, Huandoy, Pisco, Chacraraju, Yanapaccha, and Chopicalqui mountains. Their “elevation range between 5,700 and over 6,300 meters above sea level.”<br>
            Lake Sandoval is located not so far from Puerto maldonado. It's home to a lot of animal escicies. Coordinates: 12.605548°S 69.041885°W.<br>

Jaguars historically ranged from the southeastern United States south to eastern Argentina. They quickly disappear from areas impacted by people and are listed as near threatened by conservation authorities. Your best chance to spot one in Peru would be deep in the jungle at a secluded hotel or resort away from any city or town.
