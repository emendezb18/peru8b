        The Nazca lines are some mysterious and unusual sight that could possibly leave you a feeling of reverential respect mixed with fear or wonder. They form a really big image that you can't see when you are close to it, and you'll probably need an aerial view to see the full thing. That is exactly what happened back in the 1920s, when it was not discovered until a group of planes flying around the area saw that those lines formed different images. According to those images, it seemed that they were from some point between 900 B.C to 600 A.D, product of the Parasca and Nazca.(Dylan)<br>
