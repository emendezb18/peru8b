        <p class="texto">The amazonian is a natural preserved Jungle located mainly in brazil, peru, and colombia. It is home for more than 400 types of mammals and nearly 2,000 types of birds. The peruvian Amazon jungle is one of the areas with the most biodiversity in the world, and Because it is a natural preserved place, it is  the least populated area of peru. It's also the place where the amazonian river (one of the biggest rivers in the world ) is located. The amazonian jungle plays a very important role in Peru and all of the world, it regulates the oxygen and the carbons cycle. This means that it takes the carbon dioxide and converts it into oxygen. The amazon also contains a large variety of plants of which a big amount have curative properties. It also contains a lot of things that we usually consume like Chocolate, vanilla, cinnamon, pepper, and coffee. All of these plant species besides being useful for the men, they also have an important role in the ecosystem. Tourists can interact with this wild and fabulous place by staying in amazonian hotels, with cruisers on the amazon river and more!(Sara)</p>
