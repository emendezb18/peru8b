        Considered a masterpiece of colonial architecture, this monastery is a large complex of rooms, picturesque plazas, ornate fountains and a maze of narrow, cobblestone streets. It is really interesting for people who are into that type of stuff. We have found this and its mazes, fountains, plazas, flora,expressively interesting. It's important to the country because Peru has a lot of monasteries but unlike this one this one is special  and it helps with its tourism rate and interest in the country.(Dylan)<br>
