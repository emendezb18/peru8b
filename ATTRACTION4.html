        <p class="texto">The famous Inca Trail is a four-day hike that ends at Machu Picchu and is considered by many to be the highlight of their Peruvian vacation. This amazing trail is often more difficult than many people expect, but it is also more rewarding. The Inca Trail has several starting points, but the traditional four-day hike begins at km 82 of the Cusco-Aguas Calientes rail line. From here, the trail passes through beautiful views and more than 30 Inca ruins. The most difficult part of the trail is on the second day, with a 1,200-meter elevation gain and two high passes.The hike must be done with an agency. Reservations must be made and booked well in advance. Especially during the peak season of June to August.Some agencies offer a shorter version of the hike that includes either the last two days or just the final day. There are campsites at regular intervals along the trail, as well as one at the base of Machu Picchu.Hikers can either carry their own backpack or have it transported for them, depending on the type of tour. The whole trail is a historical adventure while also being a fun one. You get to learn as you go, learning about the maya ruins and having a story to tell.
