            The rainbow mountains are the tallest mountain in Cusco and the fifth tallest in Peru. The tallest that it can get is 6,385 m.s.n.m. and it is situated 100km from cusco. The rainbow mountains are made out of different soils and minerals  that give the mountains their  unique colors. This colors are made out of: the pink color is red clay made out of mud and sand, the white color is quartzose, sandstone and marls, the red color is claysones (iron), green is phyllites (ferro magnesian), the brown is fanglomerate (magnesium), and the yellow is calcareous (sulfur). These mountains have been used since pre- Incas times as a place for offerings and worship. They are still used to this date; because of that, the rainbow mountains are considered holy in local peruvian places. The rainbow mountains are very popular in tourism mainly because of their unique colors. They are  definitely a great option for visiting.(Sara)<br>
