        <p class="texto"> The main reason for visiting Pisco, which is located about 200 kilometers south of Lima, is to visit the nearby Islas Ballestas and the Reserva Nacional de Paracas on the Paracas Peninsula.The Islas Ballestas, located almost directly west of Pisco, are home to hundreds of thousands of birds as well as large colonies of sea lions, pelicans, penguins, and dolphins.Daily boat tours to the islands depart from Paracas and Pisco in the morning. The full tour takes you past the "Candelabra," a hillside geoglyph visible from the coast, and then boating around the islands looking for wildlife. This tour is typically a half-day excursion that returns around noon. The Paracas Peninsula juts out into the sea, The Reserva Nacional Paracas, just south of Pisco, is home to Peru's largest protected coastline.The Paracas Peninsula's shoreline is home to over 200 different species of seabirds, two types of sea lions, a rare type of otter, and endangered Humboldt penguins.</p>
