    <p class="parrafo">Las Pocitas Beach is a white pale color beach that is a way better,way quieter beach alternative than Monaco's main beach. Beachgoers can enjoy wildlife watching and or viewing and horseback riding. It has many things to offer as well that they don't provide but in my opinion i would recommend going.It's important to the country because Peru has a lot of Beaches and it helps with its tourism rate and interest in the country.(Dylan)<br>
