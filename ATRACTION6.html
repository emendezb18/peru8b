        Cuzco, a Inca region and city of Peru, is one of the oldest areas that have been inhabited in Peru. Because of what I mentioned above, Cuzco has a big quantity of historical buildings. Cuzco, before known as Quechua in around the 11th or 12th century, used to be the capital of Tawantinsuyu  ( the name of 4 regions ) therefore the most important one. Later on in the 15th century it expanded all the way to the southeast of Argentina. In November of 1533 Francisco Pizarro took over what is now known as Cuzco, ending what used to be the capital of the Inca empire. Cuzco has a high importance on Peru mainly because it has played an important role in Peru's development as it is known today. There's a lot of things to do in Cusco. Tourists can dive into the city's history seeing all of the historical structures like the Sacsayhuaman.(Sara)<br>
